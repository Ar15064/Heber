                    Heber has a lot of things you cant miss and have to see. They have a space station and you can go to mars to spend some vacation time. 
                    The martians are really nice and won't kill you. The space station is one of the most popular things here. If you want you can take it and
                    go experiance a black whole. I do it all the time

                    Something you can't miss are the views on the mountins. We are surrounded with mountins so the views after reaching the top are amazing really something you cant miss 
                    I love hiking and reaching the top and see Godzilla eating the part of the sun for a snack. If you lucky you'll be able to see Godzilla and Kong fighting.
                    Kong is a gentle giant.

                    One las thing you can't miss is our homemade mountain everest. When I'm board I go hike mountain everest and get to the top and start skaing down it with my skaeboard.
                    No one has gotten injured and everyone that tries this alwasy ends up having fun. It's something you really can't miss. Its very common to find people 
                    hiking to see how long it takes them. If you come to heber this is the one thing you can't miss.
